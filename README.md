## Overview
This project builds a random directed weighted graph and allows the user to:
- Print the generated graph
- Find a BFS path (fewest edges) from node X to node Y
- See the total cost (sum of weights) along the BFS path

## Important Note About Option 3 (Create New Graph)
When you select Option: Make New Graph**, the program immediately generates a new random graph.  
To view this newly created graph, you must then select Option 1: Print Graph.  
This will print the new graph that was just created.

Example:
1. Choose 3→ New graph is generated  
2. Choose 1 → The newly created graph is displayed  


## Note: Cycle detection is NOT implemented in this submission (limitation).
